**analyze:** 
A set of tools for bumper pool data analysis at Duke University. A parse utility (parse.py) is used to parse the existing ledger of all recorded games into a useful json data format. In progress. 

Check out [**bump-explore**](https://github.com/suyashkumar/bump-explore), a Flask/Angular application that lets players explore their data (using the bump-util package).
